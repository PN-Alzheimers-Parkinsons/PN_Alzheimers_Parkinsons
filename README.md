# Team Research Project: A Systems Biology Approach to Investigate the Role of Cholesterol in Neurodegenerative Diseases
This GitHub repository contains the complete computational work done as part of the team research project for the 2019 cohort of the MPhil in Biotechnology at the University of Cambridge. The project investigated the role of cholesterol in the following neurodegenerative diseases:
- [x] Alzheimer's disease (AD)
- [x] Parkinson's disease (PD)
- [x] Niemann-Pick Type C disease (NPCD)

After devising diagrams for the biological networks of these diseases, we modelled them using hybrid functional Petri nets (HFPNs). Finally, an HFPN was constructed for an integrated model of the three diseases. 

## Prerequisites
You will need the following to run our code:
* Python 3
* pipenv
* Git

## Getting started
### Launch the virtual environment
1. To install all the necessary Python packages, use
`pipenv install`
2. To launch a virtual environment that contains all the necessary Python packages, run
`pipenv shell`
from the root directory. 

### Launch a Jupyter notebook
Once in the virtual environment, use
`jupyter notebook`
to launch a Jupyter notebook.
